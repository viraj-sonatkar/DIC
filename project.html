          <h2>2. Electronic Braille Reader</h2>
          <p>•  The Electronic Braille Reader converts English text to Braille code and enables the visually impaired to sense and read through touch. Six servo motors are connected to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and are powered using a Lithium Polymer battery.
            <br>• When a pen drive with the file to-be read is inserted in the Raspberry Pi, the contents of the pen drive are displayed on the screen one by one.
            <br>• Once the file is chosen (by pressing the appropriate key), the text is decoded and sent to the motors thus enabling reading.</p>

          <h2>5. Quad Copter for Agricultural Application</h2>
          <p>•  Agriculture needed production and protection materials to achieve high productivity. Agriculture fertilizer and chemical frequently needed to kill insects and growth of crops.
            <br>• In that more than one lakh deaths in each year, especially in developing countries due to the pesticides sprayed by human being. The pesticide affects the nervous system of humans and also leads to disorders in body.
            <br>• A remote controlled UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is used to spray the Pesticide as well as fertilizer to avoid the humans from pesticide poison. The UAV is operated by manual flight plans and the Sprayer is manually triggered by RF controlled Nozzle.</p>

          <h2>6. A Smart Water Monitoring Solution for the Campus</h2>
          <p>•  This is a project-based course in which you will build an IoT based Smart Water Monitoring System that can detect the flow of water and record the volume of water that flows through the pipe for a given period of time.
            <br>• The data is then sent to the cloud for storage and analysis.
            <br>• By placing this system in a smart building, we will be able to collect and analyse the water usage patterns of the residents and save a lot of water from wastage.</p>

          <h2>7. Wearable device to Monitor Pulse rate and Temperature of Cab drivers</h2>
          <p>•  The  increasing  number  of  cab  accidents  has  been mostly  due  to  the  bad  health  condition  of  the  cab  driver.
            <br>• A wearable device was designed and made to monitor the pulse rate and body temperature, analyze the sensor data and then inform the user  about  the  cab  drivers  health  status  using  Bluetooth module and an app designed for this purpose.</p>
